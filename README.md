# Image Clustering Project

This Jupyter Notebook-based project focuses on image clustering using machine learning. Employing algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, the project groups similar images, providing a comprehensive exploration of unsupervised learning in image analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. In a Jupyter Notebook cell, run:

```python
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Running the Code

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook (`image_clustering.ipynb`).
2. Open the notebook in your Jupyter environment.
3. Execute the code cells to perform image clustering using various algorithms.

## Image Clustering and Evaluation

The project utilizes clustering techniques to group similar images together. Visualize clustering results and evaluate performance using metrics such as silhouette score.

## Results

Explore visually appealing results showcasing grouped images. Adjust clustering parameters to enhance performance and understand the effectiveness of different algorithms in image clustering.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into unsupervised learning for image clustering. Use the Jupyter Notebook as a reference for future image analysis tasks or as a starting point for more complex clustering projects.
